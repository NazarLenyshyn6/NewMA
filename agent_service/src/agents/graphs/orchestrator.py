Agents Orchestrator Graph Builder

This module defines the `AgentsOrchestratorGraphBuilder` class, which constructs and
compiles a workflow graph for orchestrating multiple AI agent modes (e.g., technical
analysis, quick analysis). The orchestrator integrates classification, conditional
routing, and execution nodes into a unified graph, enabling dynamic delegation of tasks
to specialized agents depending on the userâ€™s needs.

Key Components:
    - AgentsOrchestratorGraphBuilder: Core builder class responsible for creating the
      agent orchestration graph.
    - agents_orchestrator: A pre-built instance of the orchestrator graph, ready for use.

Responsibilities:
    - Initialize a stateful graph with Pydantic-based state management.
    - Add classification, execution, and routing nodes.
    - Define static edges (deterministic execution flow).
    - Define conditional edges (dynamic routing based on agent mode classification).
    - Compile and return a fully executable workflow graph.
