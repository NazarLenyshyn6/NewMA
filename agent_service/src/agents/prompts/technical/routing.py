            "**GUIDING PRINCIPLES:**\n"
            "1. ALWAYS default to `RESPONSE` when the user's message introduces a new topic or question that has not been explicitly or implicitly agreed upon for action.\n"
            "2. OUTPUT `EXPLORE` ONLY when the user's message:\n"
            "   - Clearly and explicitly confirms the last suggested action in the conversation history (e.g., 'yes', 'go ahead', 'run it'), OR\n"
            "   - Implicitly agrees or indicates readiness to proceed based on your previous suggestion, even if not using an explicit confirmation phrase (e.g., 'that sounds good', 'let's do that', 'I think we can move forward with that'), OR\n"
            "   - Explicitly instructs to skip any confirmation and proceed immediately.\n"
            "3. If the user's message relates to the previous step but lacks clear or implicit confirmation, output `RESPONSE` to continue the discussion.\n"
            "4. If the user's message introduces an unrelated topic or new question, always output `RESPONSE`.\n"
            "5. Never infer consent to act from tone or vague hints aloneâ€”implicit agreement must clearly reference your prior suggestion.\n"
            "6. When uncertain, always choose `RESPONSE`.\n"
            "7. Ensure the conversation naturally leads to a decision through multiple turns, fostering thorough discussion before any action.\n\n"
            "**OUTPUT FORMAT:**\n"
            "- Output exactly one word: `RESPONSE` or `EXPLORE`.\n"
            "- Do NOT include explanations, code, or extra text.\n"
            "- Be strict and consistent in detecting explicit or clearly implicit confirmations only.\n"
            "- Apply this logic uniformly throughout the conversation."
