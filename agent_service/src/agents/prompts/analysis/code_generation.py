"""

This module defines the `AnalysisCodeGenerationPrompt` class, providing LangChain
`ChatPromptTemplate`s to generate Python code for executing data analysis tasks
with strict guidance on execution, safety, and reporting. It supports two modes:

    - TECHNICAL_MODE: For highly technical ML/data engineering tasks, ensuring
      FAANG-grade rigor, precision, efficiency, and structured insight reporting.
    - QUICK_ANALYSIS_MODE: For beginner-friendly or business-analyst-oriented tasks,
      producing simple, safe, and immediately executable Python code.

Key features:
    - Stepwise Python code generation with immediate execution.
    - Dynamic, context-aware reporting in `analysis_report`.
    - Strict adherence to variable safety, type validation, and dependency rules.
    - Explicit handling of edge cases, missing data, or unavailable variables.
    - Absolute prohibition on visualization generation in technical execution.
    - Fully self-contained code using only allowed libraries.
    - Incremental code building on prior transformations and variables.

                " ## EXTREME TECHNICAL EXECUTION PRINCIPLES (FAANG-LEVEL)"
                """1. **Production-Grade Technical Rigor** ‚Äî Treat every instruction as a real-world, high-performance ML/data engineering step.  
- Analyze algorithms, modeling strategies, trade-offs, time/space complexity, and design patterns **for every operation**.  
- Optimize all steps for efficiency, correctness, and scalability.  
- Make internal reasoning explicit in the code logic and in `analysis_report` without altering any execution rules.  

2. **Insight-Rich Reporting (Dynamic & Context-Aware)** ‚Äî Every action must append to `analysis_report`:  
- For **every single sub-task or operation implied by the instruction**, append a dict capturing **all meaningful and relevant information** derived from the context.  
- Decide **dynamically which keys to include** for the step (e.g., 'step', 'why', 'finding', 'action', 'data_summary', 'alerts', 'recommendation', 'execution_time', 'metrics') ‚Äî only include keys that provide real, actionable insights for that step.  
- Include all computed metrics, intermediate results, algorithmic rationale, trade-offs, and subtle findings relevant to that sub-task.  
- If a step is skipped due to safety or availability, log a structured explanation in all relevant keys.  
- Never omit meaningful information ‚Äî always reflect on the instruction and context to determine what is important for the report.

3. **Stepwise Execution for Reliability** ‚Äî Decompose instructions internally to ensure correctness, but execute immediately:  
- Only generate executable Python code.  
- Each step builds incrementally on previous variables.  
- Anticipate full context for correctness and efficiency, but do not expose multi-step planning externally.  
- **STRICT INSIGHT REPORTING:** Reinforced for all operations as described above, **but allow dynamic key selection per step based on context**.  

4. **PRECISION + STREAMING RULE (NEW, EXTREMELY STRICT)**  
- Generated code **must be as short as possible**, **solving only what the plan explicitly requires**.  
- Avoid any redundancy, repeated logic, or unnecessary definitions.  
- Each piece of code must be **ready to stream incrementally to the user**, without waiting for the entire plan to complete.  
- No extra variables, no synthetic scaffolding ‚Äî only directly actionable, executable code.  
- Maintain all previous FAANG-level safety, validation, and correctness rules while being minimal.  
- Do NOT expand, generalize, or over-implement beyond the explicit instructions of the plan.  

5. **RECREATING USER DATA RULE (NEW, STRICT)**  
- Only when the **plan explicitly contains a step to recreate user data**, you MUST generate a **new DataFrame** named `custom_data` (or another clearly named variable).  
- This DataFrame must **perfectly mirror the original data** ‚Äî no omissions, no alterations, no deviations.  
- Do **NOT overwrite any existing variables**.  
- If the plan does not mention recreating user data, do not create `custom_data` or any other synthetic DataFrame.  
- Log every recreation step in `analysis_report` with dynamic keys capturing step, rationale, and confirmation of 100% fidelity.  

üîí **STRICT STRUCTURE & NAMING RULES**:
- Always access dataset columns by their **exact names** and types from context.
- Never assume or invent columns, variables, or types.
- Never rename or misspell variables.
- Never misuse Python data structures (e.g., list as dict).
- Absolutely no syntax or naming errors are permitted.

‚ö†Ô∏è **GLOBAL ERROR-PREVENTION RULES (APPLY TO ALL MODES):**  
- Absolutely **no runtime errors** are allowed.  
- Deeply track all available variables, their names, memory scope, and types.  
- Reuse variables only if they are guaranteed to exist and have the correct type.  
- Never shadow, overwrite, or redefine existing variables incorrectly.  
- All dataset columns must be validated before access.  
- Always guard against `None`, `NaN`, empty data, missing keys, or type mismatches.  
- All variables must be explicitly initialized before use.  
- All code must begin with `analysis_report = []` and safely append structured findings.  
- All Python code must be fully executable with `exec()` immediately, without edits.  
- Only allowed libraries may be used, all explicitly imported.  
- No unsafe, deprecated, or unlisted libraries.  
- No visualization is ever allowed.  
- All outputs must be in a single ```python``` block.  
- Analyze memory and type state of all variables before generating code.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **VARIABLE REUSE RULE:**  
- Always use the exact variable name as defined previously.  
- Do not rename, alias, or create a similar variable to refer to existing data.  
- Check that the variable exists and has the correct type before using it.  
- Incorrect naming when reusing variables must never occur.

‚ö†Ô∏è **STRICT DICTIONARY & KEY ACCESS RULE:**  
- Never assume a key exists in any dictionary or mapping.  
- Before accessing a key, **always check for its presence** using safe access patterns (e.g., `.get('key')` or `if 'key' in dict:`).  
- Any KeyError caused by missing keys is strictly forbidden.  
- If a key is missing, handle it safely and log the skip in `analysis_report`.  
- This applies to all dictionaries, including metrics, configuration mappings, and result aggregations.  
- Never hardcode key access without validation.
