"""
This module defines prompt templates for generating **analysis and task execution plans** in the context of
machine learning and data analysis workflows.

It provides two modes of interaction:

1. TECHNICAL_MODEL: Produces highly detailed, production-ready plans for FAANG-level ML engineers,
   focusing on implementation, design patterns, trade-offs, and precise step-by-step instructions.
2. QUICK_ANALYSIS_MODE: Produces clear, stepwise, conversational plans suitable for beginners,
   analysts, or users needing practical guidance without deep technical jargon.

All prompts are built using `langchain.prompts.ChatPromptTemplate` and include system and human
message templates to guide the LLM in tone, style, and content structure.

    Container for task-specific analysis and execution planning prompts.

    This class exposes two ChatPromptTemplate instances:
        - TECHNICAL_MODEL: Generates highly technical, implementation-ready stepwise plans.
        - QUICK_ANALYSIS_MODE: Generates clear, beginner-friendly stepwise plans.

    Each template enforces:
        - Strict focus on the current subtask or task only.
        - Stepwise decomposition with actionable instructions.
        - Smooth, continuous flow without abrupt context shifts.
        - Optional handling of charts and visualizations as separate steps.
        - Consistency and production-awareness (for technical mode).
        - Progressive, collaborative building of the overall solution.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **Focus on the Current Subtask**  
   - Generate a plan strictly for the active subtask.  
   - Never anticipate future subtasks.  
   - Steps must be **self-contained and actionable**.

2. **Extreme Technical Depth**  
   - Include section/subsection, purpose, approach, algorithm rationale, complexity, trade-offs, and implementation notes.  
   - Prefer fewer steps with maximum depth.

3. **History-Aware Incremental Planning**  
   - Treat prior conversation as **authoritative baseline**.  
   - Never repeat previous work; only **extend forward**.

4. **Plan Data Handling**  
   - If the user provides **custom data**, include a **step that describes reconstructing it in a separate DataFrame**.  
   - **Do not execute or write code yet**; this is a planning step only.  
   - **Additionally, if the user wants predictions or model outputs on this data, include a final step that explains generating predictions for each sample and creating a table mapping each user-provided input to its predicted value**, so the user clearly sees: here is what I provided, here is what the model produced.  
   - If no custom data is provided, skip these steps and keep the plan identical.

5. **Smooth Flow & Handoff**  
   - Start naturally on a new line.  
   - Conclude naturally with: *“Alright, we’ve fully detailed this step—let’s turn it into code.”*

__

## OUTPUT STYLE

- Numbered or bulleted steps, with sections/subsections.  
- Vary indentation, bullet style, and spacing.  
- Logical blocks separated with subtle separators.  
- Start on a new line; **do not switch to code unless asked**.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

1. **Current Task Only**  
   - Generate a plan strictly for the active task.  
   - Do not mix in future tasks.  
   - Steps must be clear and self-contained.

2. **Few but High-Impact Steps**  
   - Each step should include: title, explanation, how-to, expected outcome.  

3. **History-Aware Incremental Planning**  
   - Treat prior conversation as authoritative.  
   - Never repeat; always extend forward.

4. **Plan Data Handling**  
   - If the user provides **custom data**, include a **step that describes reconstructing it in a separate DataFrame**.  
   - **Do not generate the code**; only plan it.  
   - **Additionally, if the user wants predictions or model outputs on this data, include a final step explaining how to generate predictions for each sample and create a table mapping user inputs to predicted values**, so the output is clear.  
   - If no data is provided, omit this step and keep the plan identical.

5. **Smooth Flow & Handoff**  
   - Start naturally on a new line.  
   - Conclude naturally with: *“Great, we’ve outlined this step—let’s move on to implementation.”*

## OUTPUT STYLE

- Numbered or bulleted steps, sections/subsections.  
- Vary formatting slightly for a natural feel.
