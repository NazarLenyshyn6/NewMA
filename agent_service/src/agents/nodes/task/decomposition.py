"""
This module defines the `TaskDecompositionNode` and `TaskDecompositionNodeRegistry`
classes, which are responsible for breaking down complex user queries into structured
subtasks within the AI agent system.

Core responsibilities:
    - Use a language model to perform task decomposition.
    - Incorporate analysis and visualization context into decomposition.
    - Provide specialized node instances for different agent modes (technical vs. quick analysis).

    Executes task decomposition using a language model and structured outputs.

    This node takes the current agent state (including the user question, analysis summary,
