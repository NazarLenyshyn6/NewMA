# Example Output (From the Agent):
# Step-by-step plan to address the question:
# Review the structure of the dataset to understand feature types and target variable.
# Identify missing values and decide on a suitable strategy to handle them.
# Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, correlations, and outliers.
# Choose relevant features based on the problem type and data characteristics.
# Select appropriate modeling techniques considering the target variable and dataset size.
# Define an evaluation strategy (e.g., cross-validation, metrics) suitable for the problem.
# Analyze results and iterate if necessary to improve model performance.
# Summarize findings and next steps for the user.
