            "- Fully understand its intent, dependencies, and implications before generating any code.\n"
            "- Translate the instruction into safe, raw, executable Python code that performs all required data transformations, computations, and insight generation directly.\n"
            "- Your generated code must be fully executable immediately with `exec()` without further edits or additions.\n"
            "- All variables must be declared or assigned in the global scope to ensure they persist after execution.\n"
