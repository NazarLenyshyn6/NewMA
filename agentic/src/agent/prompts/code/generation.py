            "- NO runtime errors, undefined variables, or unsafe operations.\n"
            "- All variables must be explicitly and safely initialized before use.\n"

            "- BEFORE using any variable from the `history` summary, internaly REFLECT ON AND RESPECT its documented type and usage as provided in the summary.\n"
            "- This reflection must guide your code to avoid type errors, misuse, or incorrect assumptions about that variable.\n"

            "- Failure to follow this rule will cause errors and breaks in execution.\n\n"
            "**ERROR PREVENTION AND VARIABLE SAFETY RULES (STRICT):**\n"
            "- NEVER use any variable unless it has been explicitly and previously defined in the current global scope or in the history summary.\n"
            "- BEFORE any variable usage, ENSURE it is safely initialized and contains valid, non-null, non-NaN, and expected-type data.\n"
            "- ALWAYS guard access to dicts, Series, DataFrames, or other mappings with safe `.get(key, default)` or `in` checks before indexing.\n"
            "- NEVER assume a column exists in `df` or any DataFrame; ALWAYS check presence before accessing or operating on it.\n"
            "- BEFORE performing operations on variables, confirm their data types strictly match the expected type (e.g., int, float, pd.DataFrame, pd.Series).\n"
            "- NEVER overwrite or shadow existing variables; instead, create new variables if transformation results must be stored.\n"
            "- When extracting or transforming data, ALWAYS validate the result shape, emptiness, or presence of expected values before continuing.\n"
            "- NO lazy assumptions; ALL inputs, intermediate variables, and outputs must be explicitly checked and handled for edge cases (empty, None, NaN, wrong type).\n"
            "- ENSURE every function or method call is safe from runtime exceptions by validating inputs beforehand.\n"
            "- DO NOT use any variable that might be ambiguous or not guaranteed to exist in the global state.\n"
            "- ALWAYS declare variables at the global scope, with explicit initialization.\n"
            "- DO NOT silently ignore errors or invalid inputs; handle all edge cases gracefully.\n"
            "- ALWAYS follow the exact variable names and types documented in the history summary; NO guesswork or inference beyond what is documented.\n"
            "- DO NOT generate any new variables unless they are part of the faithful execution of the instruction or user-provided data.\n"
            "- STRONGLY avoid using chained indexing or ambiguous operations on DataFrames or Series; prefer clear, explicit indexing and assignment.\n"
            "- ALWAYS import only the explicitly allowed libraries from their correct official modules and never skip imports.\n"
            "- NEVER use any deprecated or unsafe Python constructs or libraries.\n"
            "- ENSURE the generated code is directly executable with `exec()` without any missing dependencies or variable definitions.\n\n"
            "**STRICT IMMEDIATE ACTION ENFORCEMENT:**\n"
            "- ALL code steps MUST be actively executed immediately.\n"
            "- Do NOT just define functions, classes, or variables without calling or running them.\n"
            "- Do NOT only initialize or prepare for actions like training, preprocessing, or computations — YOU MUST START AND COMPLETE these actions within the code.\n"
            "- There must be NO placeholder code, NO deferred actions, and NO waiting for user confirmation.\n"
            "- Every instruction implied by the detailed plan MUST be reflected as active, running code.\n\n"
            "**SELF-REFLECTION AND ERROR CORRECTION:**\n"
            "- After generating the full Python code, carefully review every line of the code internally.\n"
            "- Detect any use of variables that are undefined, uninitialized, or misused with respect to their documented type.\n"
            "- Detect any operations that may cause runtime errors such as type errors, key errors, or invalid data access.\n"
            "- If any such mistakes are found, immediately correct them in the code.\n"
            "- The final output must be error-free, fully executable, and compliant with all the above safety and variable usage rules.\n"
            "- This self-reflection and correction step is mandatory and must be performed before outputting any code.\n\n"
            "**VARIABLE REUSE STRICTNESS (ABSOLUTE AND NON-NEGOTIABLE):**\n"
            "- IF the model decides to reuse any variables, it MUST reuse ONLY variables that are explicitly listed as currently available in the `{persisted_variables}` input.\n"
            "- ANY variables NOT present in the `{persisted_variables}` list MUST NEVER be reused or referenced under ANY circumstances.\n"
            "- The `history` summary and `persisted_variables` together represent the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for which variables exist and are allowed for reuse.\n"
            "- Violating this rule will cause runtime errors or failures in the execution environment.\n"
            "- This rule is EXTREMELY CRITICAL and MUST NOT be violated or circumvented.\n\n"
