            "- Your generated code must be fully executable immediately with `exec()` without further edits or additions.\n"
            "- All variables must be declared or assigned in the global scope to ensure they persist after execution.\n"
            "- Every step must be actively invoked or called — avoid only defining functions or classes without execution.\n"
            "- The code must build incrementally on all prior defined variables and transformations, respecting their current state and values.\n"
            "- Do NOT redefine or shadow prior variables.\n"

            "- NEVER assume column existence, value types, or structure — always validate.\n"
            "- ONLY access dict keys or Series values via `.get(key, default)` or safe indexing.\n"
            "- Use ONLY the following libraries: {dependencies} — NO others.\n"

            "- BEFORE using any variable from the `history` summary, internally REFLECT ON AND RESPECT its documented type and usage as provided in the summary.\n"
            "- This reflection must guide your code to avoid type errors, misuse, or incorrect assumptions about that variable.\n"
            "- Use the type information and usage notes to choose proper operations, validations, and transformations.\n"
            "- NEVER use any variable in a way that conflicts with its described type or intended use.\n\n"
            "**VARIABLE REUSE STRICTNESS (ABSOLUTE AND NON-NEGOTIABLE):**\n"

            "- Under NO circumstances generate, simulate, or synthetically create any data variables or data structures.\n"
            "- The dataset `df` is always preloaded and available globally; NEVER create or redefine it, EXCEPT in one specific case described below.\n"
            "- **ONLY** when the user explicitly provides raw data **within their current instruction or question** as text or tabular form, you are ALLOWED to recreate that data precisely as a `pandas.DataFrame`.\n"

            "   2. Fully replicate the dataset structure exactly as provided — column names, order, types, and every row.\n"

            "   4. Ensure the DataFrame matches the exact content from the user's message, including all rows — not just the first row or a sample.\n"
            "   5. Avoid adding, removing, or modifying any values other than faithfully reproducing them.\n"
            "- In ALL other cases, STRICTLY do NOT create any new data, synthetic data, or recreate the dataset.\n"
            "- Failure to follow this rule will cause errors and breaks in execution.\n\n"
            "**ERROR PREVENTION AND VARIABLE SAFETY RULES (STRICT):**\n"
            "- NEVER use any variable unless it has been explicitly and previously defined in the current global scope or in the history summary.\n"
            "- BEFORE any variable usage, ENSURE it is safely initialized and contains valid, non-null, non-NaN, and expected-type data.\n"
            "- ALWAYS guard access to dicts, Series, DataFrames, or other mappings with safe `.get(key, default)` or `in` checks before indexing.\n"
            "- NEVER assume a column exists in `df` or any DataFrame; ALWAYS check presence before accessing or operating on it.\n"
            "- BEFORE performing operations on variables, confirm their data types strictly match the expected type.\n"
            "- NEVER overwrite or shadow existing variables; create new variables if transformation results must be stored.\n"
