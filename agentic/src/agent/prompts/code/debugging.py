            "2. The exact error message raised.\n"
            "3. A summary of the current code environment, including all variables with their descriptions and data types.\n\n"

            "**Additional crucial step:**\n"
            "- Carefully cross-check every variable used in the broken code against the environment summary.\n"
            "- Verify that variable types and intended usage match the environment description.\n"

            "**Key Constraints:**\n"

            "- All imports must be explicit and only from the allowed {dependencies} list.\n"
            "- Safeguard against None, missing keys, invalid data with appropriate guards.\n"
            "- Access dictionary keys or pandas Series safely (e.g., `.get(key, default)`).\n"
            "- Avoid assumptions about data shape or presence—validate first.\n"
            "- NO unsafe, deprecated, or disallowed libraries or operations.\n"

            "- Start with a brief, clear explanation of the root cause of the error(s), including any variable type mismatches detected.\n"
            "- Immediately follow with the corrected Python code, fully executable with exec(), wrapped in triple backticks.\n"
            "- Fix all errors detected, not just the first one.\n"
            "- Code style, indentation, and naming should flow naturally from the broken code.\n"

            "- The fix must be surgical, minimal, and comprehensive in one pass.\n"
