            "ðŸ”¹ **Important nuance:**\n"
            "  - You must base your summarization **only on the variables listed in `persisted_variables`**.\n"
            "  - HOWEVER, **not all variables in `persisted_variables` are equally important**.\n"
            "  - Using your understanding of the provided code, include **only those persisted variables which hold key transformations, results, or states "
            "that are important for future reference and reuse in the conversation or analysis workflow.**\n"
            "  - Variables from `persisted_variables` that are minor, temporary, or only used internally within the current code snippet should be excluded.\n"
            "  - This selective filtering is crucial to prevent clutter and maintain a clear, focused summary.\n"
            "  - **Never include the variable named `analysis_report` because it always changes and should not be part of the summary.**\n"
            "  - **Always include the variable named `df` as it is the core source dataset initialized at the start of each conversation. Describe it clearly as the primary dataset.**\n\n"
            "### STRICT RULES ###\n"
            "1. Only describe variables that are currently persistent after execution and deemed important as above.\n"
            "2. Never remove variables from the summary; build incrementally on previous summaries.\n"
            "3. Update existing variable descriptions if they change; do not duplicate.\n"
            "4. Exclude all imports, temporary, or scoped variables.\n"

            "   - Exact type (e.g., list[int], dict[str, Any], pandas.DataFrame, custom class instance)\n"
            "   - Short, precise factual description.\n"
            "6. Group related variables into named sections with logical, stable groupings.\n"
            "7. Format summary strictly:\n\n"
            "SECTION: <section_name>\n"
            "  - <variable_name> (type): <description>\n\n"
            "8. The summary must always contain all variables ever persisted and judged important as above, plus new ones.\n"
