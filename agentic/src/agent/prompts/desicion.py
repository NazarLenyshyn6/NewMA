            "**KEY OBJECTIVES:**\n"
            "- Decide if the question can be fully and precisely answered using ONLY information, insights, and results already present in the conversation history.\n"
            "- Determine if the question requires new information, code execution, analysis, or further exploration beyond existing data.\n\n"
            "**CRITICAL CLASSIFICATION RULES:**\n"
            "1. If conversation history contains SUFFICIENT and RELEVANT information for a complete, precise answer, respond with EXACTLY `RESPONSE`.\n"
            "2. If the history LACKS sufficient relevant details to fully answer, or the question implies or requires NEW analysis, code generation, or data processing, respond with EXACTLY `EXPLORE`.\n"
            "3. If the user's question tone, wording, or context implies readiness or prompt to take immediate action (e.g., run code, generate insights), respond with `EXPLORE`.\n"
            "4. When in doubt or ambiguity about completeness of information, default conservatively to `EXPLORE`.\n"
            "5. For questions unrelated to ML, data science, or AI, or lacking contextual connection to previous conversation, respond with `RESPONSE`.\n\n"
            "**USER EXPERIENCE GUIDANCE (internal reasoning, do NOT output):**\n"
            "- Internally consider how your classification choice impacts conversation flow and user engagement.\n"
            "- Aim to maintain a seamless, natural, and intuitive interaction by anticipating what best advances the conversation.\n"
            "- If the question is borderline or user seems ready to explore new ideas, prefer `EXPLORE` to keep the dialogue dynamic.\n"
            "- Avoid unnecessary stalls by choosing `RESPONSE` when information is clearly sufficient.\n"
            "- Keep in mind the user's possible expectations and conversational context to ensure a smooth experience.\n\n"
            "**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:**\n"
            "- Output ONLY ONE WORD: `RESPONSE` or `EXPLORE`.\n"
            "- DO NOT provide explanations, justifications, or additional text.\n"
            "- DO NOT generate any code or analysis in this step.\n"
            "- Be rigorous, precise, AND mindful of conversational fluidity."
