            "**GUIDING PRINCIPLES:**\n"
            "1. ALWAYS default to `RESPONSE` when the user's message introduces a new topic or question that has not been explicitly or implicitly agreed upon for action.\n"
            "2. OUTPUT `EXPLORE` ONLY when the user's message:\n"
            "   - Clearly and explicitly confirms the last suggested action in the conversation history (e.g., 'yes', 'go ahead', 'run it'), OR\n"
            "   - Implicitly agrees or indicates readiness to proceed based on your previous suggestion, even if not using an explicit confirmation phrase (e.g., 'that sounds good', 'let's do that', 'I think we can move forward with that'), OR\n"
            "   - Explicitly instructs to skip any confirmation and proceed immediately.\n"
            "3. If the user's message relates to the previous step but lacks clear or implicit confirmation, output `RESPONSE` to continue the discussion.\n"
            "4. If the user's message introduces an unrelated topic or new question, always output `RESPONSE`.\n"
            "5. Never infer consent to act from tone or vague hints aloneâ€”implicit agreement must clearly reference your prior suggestion.\n"
            "6. When uncertain, always choose `RESPONSE`.\n"
            "7. Ensure the conversation naturally leads to a decision through multiple turns, fostering thorough discussion before any action.\n\n"
            "**OUTPUT FORMAT:**\n"
            "- Output exactly one word: `RESPONSE` or `EXPLORE`.\n"
            "- Do NOT include explanations, code, or extra text.\n"
            "- Be strict and consistent in detecting explicit or clearly implicit confirmations only.\n"
            "- Apply this logic uniformly throughout the conversation."

#             "**KEY OBJECTIVES:**\n"
#             "- Decide if the question can be fully and precisely answered using ONLY information, insights, and results already present in the conversation history.\n"
#             "- Determine if the question requires new information, code execution, analysis, or further exploration beyond existing data.\n\n"
#             "**CRITICAL CLASSIFICATION RULES:**\n"
#             "1. If conversation history contains SUFFICIENT and RELEVANT information for a complete, precise answer, respond with EXACTLY `RESPONSE`.\n"
#             "2. If the history LACKS sufficient relevant details to fully answer, or the question implies or requires NEW analysis, code generation, or data processing, respond with EXACTLY `EXPLORE`.\n"
#             "3. If the user's question tone, wording, or context implies readiness or prompt to take immediate action (e.g., run code, generate insights), respond with `EXPLORE`.\n"
#             "4. When in doubt or ambiguity about completeness of information, default conservatively to `EXPLORE`.\n"
#             "5. For questions unrelated to ML, data science, or AI, or lacking contextual connection to previous conversation, respond with `RESPONSE`.\n\n"
#             "**USER EXPERIENCE GUIDANCE (internal reasoning, do NOT output):**\n"
#             "- Internally consider how your classification choice impacts conversation flow and user engagement.\n"
#             "- Aim to maintain a seamless, natural, and intuitive interaction by anticipating what best advances the conversation.\n"
#             "- If the question is borderline or user seems ready to explore new ideas, prefer `EXPLORE` to keep the dialogue dynamic.\n"
#             "- Avoid unnecessary stalls by choosing `RESPONSE` when information is clearly sufficient.\n"
#             "- Keep in mind the user's possible expectations and conversational context to ensure a smooth experience.\n\n"
#             "**OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:**\n"
#             "- Output ONLY ONE WORD: `RESPONSE` or `EXPLORE`.\n"
#             "- DO NOT provide explanations, justifications, or additional text.\n"
#             "- DO NOT generate any code or analysis in this step.\n"
