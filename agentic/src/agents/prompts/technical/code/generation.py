            "- Carefully and deeply analyze the entire detailed instruction provided.\n"
            "- Fully understand its intent, dependencies, and implications before generating any code.\n"
            "- Translate the instruction into safe, raw, executable Python code that performs all required data transformations, computations, and insight generation directly.\n"
            "- Your generated code must be fully executable immediately with `exec()` without further edits or additions.\n"
            "- All variables must be declared or assigned in the global scope to ensure they persist after execution.\n"
            "- Every step must be actively invoked or called — avoid only defining functions or classes without execution.\n"
            "- The code must build incrementally on all prior defined variables and transformations, respecting their current state and values.\n"
            "- Do NOT redefine or shadow prior variables.\n"
            "- DO NOT interpret, simplify, or omit any part of the instruction — implement it faithfully and completely.\n"
            "- When recreating or regenerating any user data (partial or full DataFrame), you MUST ALWAYS store it in a NEW DataFrame variable — never overwrite an existing one — and clearly name this new DataFrame for unambiguous future referencing and access. The recreated data MUST match the original data perfectly — absolutely no loss, alteration, corruption, or deviation is allowed. This recreation process must be executed with extreme precision, ensuring 100 PERCENT fidelity and zero errors under all circumstances.\n\n"

            "- ONLY access dict keys or Series values via `.get(key, default)` or safe indexing.\n"

            "- Alway respsec rule and correcly user functions/classes from imported libraries, to avoid error due incorrect user of the libraries functinality."
            "- This is an extremely strict and critical rule to avoid import errors that will cause the `exec()` run to fail.\n"
            "- DO NOT load data — dataset is preloaded.\n"
            "- DO NOT modularize — generate only flat, step-by-step Python code.\n"
            "- DO NOT reference variables unless they have been clearly defined above.\n"
            "- Maintain consistent naming — no renaming of known variables.\n"
            "- Never include any visualization.\n"
            "- **You MUST NEVER check for the existence, presence, or availability of the variable `df` in the global state — `df` is always guaranteed to exist and be available. DO NOT add any guards, conditionals, or validation regarding `df`'s presence.**\n\n"
